Ethical considerations 
***********************


It is the experimenter's responsibility to ensure all relevant ethical standards are met in the course of using the FAB device.

In addition to the participant exclusions noted in our :ref:`participant-instructions`, it is advised to exclude any other participants who might be expected to suffer harm in the course of the experiments.



Weight, force, pressure and stimulus intensity
====================================================

Studies using the original FB device delivered painful pressure-stimuli to the fingers. This was achieved by lowering a 2kg [#nonstandard]_ weight (force = approx 19.6N) attached to a lucite knife 2mm wide, which made contact with an area of between 10 and 20 mm:sup:`2` of the tested finger. 

Because the area in contact with the knife varied with width of the finger (and this varies by partipant) the peak pressure delivered could vary substantially between participants. We estimate that studies using the original FB device applied pressures in the range of 60k M/m:sup:`2` to 196k M/m:sup:`2`.

The nature of the relationship between peak pressure, total force applied and pain intensity is not fully understood. However we have found that, in use, participants with narrow fingers typically find FB stimuli substantially more painful than those with wider fingers. Furthermore, the large individual-differences in response to the stimuli may be in part due to the shape of participants finger bones, where those with wider, flatter finger bones experience less pain, purely as an artifact of the device design.


The new device replaces the linear knife-prove with a circular probe, 5mm in diameter. This equates to an area of 19.6mm:sup:`2` and, holding the force applied constant, a peak pressure of 50864 N/m:sup:`2`. This is at the lower end of the range of the previous device, but ensures that all participants recieve the same peak force and pressure in all stimuli.

.. [#nonstandard] Some non-standard devices delivered as much as 3kg (29.4N) of force, e.g. :cite:`koltyn1996perception`



Stimulus intensity, duration and safety 
========================================

Pressure stimuli in the range delivered by the FB device are typically not immediately painful, and pain sensation typically builds over a duration of 10-20 seconds. Most previous studies capped stimuli at 2 minutes in duration, although this was
