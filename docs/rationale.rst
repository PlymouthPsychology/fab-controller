Rationale for the new design 
============================================


Studies of pain and placebo analgesia have historically used a wide
variety of stimuli as laborotory analogues including electrical stimuli
[Wager2004]_, cold water (i.e. a cold pressor;
[Posner1985]_), heat [Ptrovic2002]_, iontophorensis
[Montgomery1997]_, lasers [Bingel2006]_, and pressure
[Whalley2008]_.

Pain stimuli for laborotory studies can be evaluated on a number of
dimensions: the *reliability* of the stimuli (in the sense the same stimuli
can be delivered consistently); *validity* of the stimuli, in the sense
that it corresponds to real world pain experiences; *repeatability*, in
the sense that multiple stimuli can be given in a single experiment;
whether *deception* is possible --- that is, whether participants can be
convincingly misinformed about the stimuli to be delivered (this would, for exaple, 
allow placebo-conditioning studies to take place, e.g. [Montgomery1997]_; and
the *expense* and *practicality* of the techniques — for example whether
the equipment can be used by students without additional supervision.

Focal pressure, applied to the skin over bone, is a method of evoking
experimental pain of an 'aching' nature. The experienced sensation is
relatively closely related to the pressure applied, and many studies of
pain and placebo analgesia use pressure stimuli because they are cheap,
practical, reliable and have reasonable ecological validity (see Table
for a comparison of the different types of pain stimulator available).
The FB device is used to apply pressure to the fingers via lever [Forgione1971]_, see figure.  However, three important limitations of the original FB device are that 

1. it is impossible to deceive pariticpants as to the true magnitude of the
stimulus to be delivered, ruling out conditioning studies
2. it is impossible to blind experimenters to the stimuli to be delivered (e.g. via computer control), and that 
3. the reliability of pain measurements is limited by the resolution of pain self report scales.

The FAB is designed to resolve all three of these limitations.
